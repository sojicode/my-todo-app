My GitHub URL: 

Create an application todo-app and this application contains a dashboard component, a todo-item component, a todo-list component, a new-todo-item component, and a page-not-found component. I added a main component so when you connect to the web it shows the main page first and then you can navigate from the main page to the dashboard page. 

The dashboard page displays a list of todo list items as well as a component for adding new todo items. There are three buttons that belong to todo-item: urgent, days, week. You can choose only one button. 

Also, I created todo-service and injected this service into component and used the function from the service. There are two functions: adding and updating.

Additionally, I set up a new firebase account and created a new firebase project.
